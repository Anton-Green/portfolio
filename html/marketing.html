                Usually people saying that you should tailor your resume for every specific employer. <br />
                It is a good option, but then, you spending all day by researching and sending just a dozen of resumes. <br /> <br />
                In that case, you didn't have time to work on your skills. I think it is better to write a script that will do it for you <br />
                and spend your time by developing your skills. <br /> <br />
                What do you think about that?
            </p>

            <p>
                Some tips for myself: <br />
                1. It is good way to store useful mails at server. <br />
                2. In script I can get a list from server and write a script that will send email to every element personally. <br />
                3. When you sending for a few recipients at one time your message will me marked as "unimportant". <br />
                4. No more than one e-mail to unique recipient if I don't want to lose "Important according to Google magic" <br />
